Twilio Complete Call Record
===========================

Main drawback of twilio is we cannot record a complete call. Only calls dialled after accepting call will be recorded.
By using this scenario, we are completely recording a call. For this, we need two twilio numbers.

In this project, i have developed a small ivr where call will be redirected to an agent when caller press one. By this project, we will get complete call record in status callback script.
Let us consider caller calls to number **A**. **A**'s voice url should be configured to **www.your-domain.com/twilio-complete-call-record/incoming.php** and **status callback url as www.your-domain.com/twilio-complete-call-record/status_callback.php**.

From **incoming.php**, call will be dialled to another twilio number **B**. **B**'s voice url should be configured to **www.your-domain.com/twilio-complete-call-record/call_handler_one.php**.
In **config.php**, save this **B** number as **twilio_redirect_num**. Also, save your agents number as **agent_number** in **config.php**.

After completing call to agent, call recording will be availabel in **recordings** folder.
